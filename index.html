    <h2>What is this?</h2>
    <p>
      I built this website to share the projects I create in my free time with you guys. I code projects in Python from Reinforcement Learning agents to LLMS (1B parameter - pretty small!). I was once a college student tinkering as I learned - the futher I go 
      the more I'm able to create. My hope is that you discover something here that inspires you. Build something awesome, and share it on our blog! Meanwhile, take a look around. Talk to my <a href ="chat.html">chat bot</a>. Help him <a href="project-chat-data.html">learn something</a>. 
      Glad you're here.
    </p>

    <h2>What's happening now?</h2>
    <p>
      My current project is a small language model built in-house. Not quite from the ground up, but the Pytorch code goes down to the Linear layers, GELU activations, and matrix multiplications to implement weight sharing. It's not the most in-depth codebase. It's not the best performing model. But its mine! And it's a project you can absolutely do as well. Check out the current progress <a href="./project-chat.html">here.</a></p>
    </p>

    <h2>What you'll find?</h2>
    <p>
      I have spent years coding passion projects at late hours - only to be hidden away on my personal desktop. I want a place for them to be discovered and to inspire. That's why I made this site. Look around and find something to create! 

    </p>

    <h2>What's next?</h2>
    <p>
      I'd love to add a blog, a forum to see what you all have done, and many more projects!
    </p>

    <h2>Try the Chat Interface</h2>
    <p>
      Head over to the <a href="./chat.html">Chat page</a> to interact with the current running version of the SLM. Real-time stats included.
