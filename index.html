    <h2>What is this?</h2>
    <p>
      Here you will find passion projects of mine that I hope inspire others to create as well. A collection of everything I've been working on since I started my degree in computer science in 2018. I aim to make these both professional and accessible to everyone. Take a look around and let me know what you think! Did you find anything that piques your interest? I'd love to know if you do.  
    </p>

    <h2>What's happening now?</h2>
    <p>
      My current project is a small language model built in-house. Not quite from the ground up, but the Pytorch code goes down to the Linear layers, GELU activations, and matrix multiplications to implement weight sharing. It's not the most in-depth codebase. It's not the best performing model. But its mine! And it's a project you can absolutely do as well. Check out the current progress <a href="./project-chat.html">here.</a></p>
    </p>

    <h2>What you'll find?</h2>
    <p>
      Everything here has been curated by me over the course of days, weeks, and months behind a keyboard - passionately engaged in ML projects. I launched this site in 2025 to give a public face to everything I've created. There was something missing about spending hours developing only to have but myself to enjoy it. This project serves to provide those who are curious with a tangible way to interact with what I've built. And to hopefully inspire others with what is possible with some creativity and hard work.  
    </p>

    <h2>What's next?</h2>
    <p>
      This site will serve as the hub for live chat demos, dev logs, project breakdowns, and long-form technical writeups. Stay tuned as my projects evolve through new data phases, architecture iterations, and deployment stages.
    </p>

    <h2>Try the Chat Interface</h2>

      Head over to the <a href="./chat.html">Chat page</a> to interact with the current running version of the SLM. Real-time stats included.
