    <h2>The Story Behind SLM Chat</h2>
    <p>
      This is a toy project designed to provide a functional interface to interact with custom Small Language Models (SLMs). It began as a lightweight experiment to explore local inference and custom chatbot interfaces.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the interface and functionality are currently minimal, the intention is to improve it gradually. Over time, this project aims to serve as a foundation for more advanced features like long-term memory, multiple model routing, user authentication, and dynamic fine-tuning.
    </p>
    <p>
      It’s a proof of concept: usable in its current state, but expect rough edges. Development will continue as time and interest permit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thank you for checking it out — and feel free to experiment or suggest improvements.
